# Notebookify
Mobile web app produced with Flask, HTML, CSS (Bootstrap), and Javascript that shows users stylized data and graphs (through Plotly and Pandas) about their top Spotify statistics and playlists.

Notebookify will eventually be deployed and usable online for recreational use once it is approved by Spotify Developer Guidelines. 

To run this application locally, follow the steps below:
1. Clone this repository to your local computer.
2. Ensure all dependencies are downloaded (including Flask, Plotly, Pandas, and Numpy).
3. Visit developer.spotify.com and login with Spotify.
4. Create a new project and copy your Client ID and Client Secret.
5. Create a folder titled '.env' in the repository and add the following variables:
  - CLIENT_ID = (your client ID as a string)
  - CLIENT_SECRET = (your client secret as a string)
6. Run app.py on Localhost to interact with the website.
